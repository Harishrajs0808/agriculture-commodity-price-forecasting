# Agriculture Commodity Prices Forecasting using Time Series Models

This project aims to forecast agriculture commodity prices using time series forecasting techniques (ARIMA and SARIMA models). A web interface has been developed using the Django framework to make forecasting accessible to users with minimal technical background.

# Project Highlights
1. Real-time Data Collection of agriculture commodity prices
2. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and formatting
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Trend analysis, seasonality, and correlations
4. Forecasting Models:
   a) ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
   b) SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)

# Web Application using Python Django for interactive forecast visualization and input file upload
1. Visual outputs: Time series plots, forecast graphs, RMSE error metrics
2. Technologies Used
   a) Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels)
   b) Django Web Framework
   c) HTML, CSS (for front-end rendering)
   d) Excel/CSV file handling

# Web App Features
1. Upload your Excel dataset
2. View trend analysis and heatmaps
3. See commodity-wise forecasting results
4. Graphical view of ARIMA and SARIMA predictions
5. RMSE metrics for model accuracy
